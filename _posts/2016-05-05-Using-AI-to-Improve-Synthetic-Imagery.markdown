Reading "[How Deep Learning Networks Can Use Virtual Worlds To Solve Real World Problems](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2016/05/05/how-deep-learning-networks-can-use-virtual-worlds-to-solve-real-world-problems/)" and "[Artificial Intelligence Can Now Design Realistic Video and Game Imagery](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601258/artificial-intelligence-can-now-design-realistic-video-and-game-imagery/)" got me to thinking about how we can use AI to improve synthetic imagery. Rather than simply "create high-quality videos or images from low-resolution ones", instead use AI to tunnel through the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley). Allow the algorithm to learn the difference between a synthetic (virtual) world and a real one and automatically fill in the gaps as needed. Providing this as a configurable step in the [graphics pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline) may provide for never-seen-before photo-realistic worlds.

Some interesting academic work in this area:
