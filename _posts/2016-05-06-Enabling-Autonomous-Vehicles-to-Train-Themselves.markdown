The article "[How Deep Learning Networks Can Use Virtual Worlds To Solve Real World Problems](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2016/05/05/how-deep-learning-networks-can-use-virtual-worlds-to-solve-real-world-problems/)" introduced me to the idea of augmenting a real world data set with data from a virtual world. This allows one to "what if" an infinite number of scenarios without having to attempt to find or create the situation in the real world data. Leveraging this, a system can be built to teach itself ([in the spirit](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/9/11185030/google-deepmind-alphago-go-artificial-intelligence-impact) of [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/alpha-go)) and could lead to great advances in automous vehicle safety in sooner-than-expected timeframes. This system could also be used to determine how sensor quality and changes in position or number of sensors would affect the resulting driving.
