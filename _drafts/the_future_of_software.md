title:  Software's Greatest Challenge
subtitle: State-of-the-art research into simplifying software construction and maintenance
description: How far have we progressed towards Donald Knuth's 1984 challenge of "instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do"?

With few (unremarkable) exceptions, writing software requires a developer to build a mental model of the desired system and then translate that model into the appropriate programming language "sentences". This is a manual and labor-intensive task and has not fundamentally changed since its inception decades ago. Even with the introduction of the much lauded Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), the burden still rests primarily on the developer while the computer does very little to assist in this task.

Donald Knuth challenged us over two decades ago with the following call to action: "instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do." I present an additional challenge to imagine that the computer's task is to understand what the human being wants it to do.

_How far have we come_ in the last few decades towards this goal and where is the state-of-the-art research headed? This series of blog posts will investigate these questions and I will provide insights based on my personal experiences professionally managing software over the past two decades.
